## My passions

### 🤖 Artificial Sensing


### 🧩 Making Complexity Simple
As a lead developer, I've developed a deep interest in effectively communicating with various stakeholders i.e. potential users, key decision-makers, upper management, and colleagues- to ensure project success. I've come to appreciate how the presentation of an idea can be tailored to different audiences, and how the right words can be the difference between driving innovation forward or leaving it stalled.

In my experience, I've also come to realize that simplicity is key. As counterintuitive as it may seem, less is often more. Stripping away the unnecessary and focusing on the essential is crucial to capture the attention in an age where our attention spans are shrinking, and we're constantly overwhelmed with information.


### ✍ Digital Communication
An interplay of different factors plays a crucial role in making an application successful. During hackathons, I've often realized that the majority of ideas we come up with are not entirely new- thousands, if not more, have had the same concept before us, and many have implemented it with impressive technology. Yet, even the most advanced and elegant solutions are only part of the equation for success, much like Facebook's journey.

The other essential factor is how you present and sell an idea. The way stories are engineered and communicated is to me dreadful yet sublime- it has the power to steer the world by reverse-engineering our innermost feelings, exploiting our natural brain's mechanisms. Crafting a compelling narrative and effectively communicating your vision are crucial for gaining traction. Stories have accompanied us throughout our lives, from childhood to adulthood, and have played a pivotal role in human evolution. The art of digital communication, branding, and marketing (call it what you will) fascinates me. These tools have the power to determine whether a collection of code lines will remain obscure or become transformative.
