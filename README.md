## My passions

### 🤖 Artificial Sensing


### 🧩 Making Complexity Simple
As a lead developer, I've developed a deep interest in effectively communicating with various stakeholders i.e. potential users, key decision-makers, upper management, and colleagues- to ensure project success. I've come to appreciate how the presentation of an idea can be tailored to different audiences, and how the right words can be the difference between driving innovation forward or leaving it stalled.

In my experience, I've also come to realize that simplicity is key. As counterintuitive as it may seem, less is often more. Stripping away the unnecessary and focusing on the essential is crucial to capture the attention in an age where our attention spans are shrinking, and we're constantly overwhelmed with information.
